**Existing System**
    Today we have many drawing tools example draw.io,Lucidchart,Sketch,etc which will allow the user to design and create diagrams, that can convey exact and more information to the audience in a given point of time.


**Problem with the existing system**
    As the time passes, when it requires to add a new requirement, the designed diagram become out-of-date. 
    Manually we need to keep track of the every diagram which undergoes for changes at each stage.
    Diagram version control is very difficult task.
    Sharing diagram with peers and Updating the same is another difficult task.
    
**Solution**

   Fits with a developer workflow. It provides ease of better understanding and helps everyone to edit and contribute in easy and effective way.
   Best fits with modern practices of CI/CD methods.
